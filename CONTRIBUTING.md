# Contributing

This document will guide you through setting up your local environment to start developing for this project. It also covers
the steps needed to get a [hacked retail PS Vita](https://vita.hacks.guide/) ready for development.

## Bug Reports

To report bugs simply open a new GitHub Issue for this project. It's most helpful if you include steps to reproduce the issue
and if you can attach some screenshots to it.

## Setup Local Development Environment

This project is built using the Vita SDK. You must have it installed before developing for this project. For more information
about that go here: https://vitasdk.org/

Once you have that installed you can reference the [GitHub Actions YAML files](./.github/) to see what you need to build the
project on macOS or Linux. If you're using Windows it's
[recommended to use WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

## Setup Development PS Vita

This project's [Makefile](Makefile) is designed to quickly deploy new development builds to a hardware PS Vita running
**vitacompanion** and **Cat-A-Log**.

### vitacompanion

[vitacompanion](https://github.com/devnoname120/vitacompanion) provides an always-on FTP server that this project uses to:

- Upload new builds to the PS Vita
- Download logs and screenshots from the PS Vita
- Reboot the PS Vita

To install vitacompanion on the PS Vita:

1. Download **vitacompanion.suprx** from: https://github.com/devnoname120/vitacompanion/releases/latest
2. Upload the file to the PS Vita into the directory: **ur0:tai/**
3. Add this to **ur0:tai/config.txt**:
    ```text
    *main
    ur0:tai/vitacompanion.suprx
    ```
4. Reboot the PS Vita
5. Get the PS Vita's IP address: Settings > Network > Internet Connection Status

#### Verify

> [!NOTE]
> The Makefile will first move all screenshots on the PS Vita out of their random subdirectories and into the parent
> directory. In other words the SCREENSHOT directory structure will be flattened.

Take a screenshot (PS Button + Start) and then run (replace 192.168.0.100 with your PS Vita's IP address):

```bash
make PSVITA_IP=192.168.0.100 fetch-screenshots
ls fetch-screenshots
```

For more commands, run:

```bash
make help
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you get **Access failed: 550 Invalid directory** I've opened a bug report for it here:
> https://github.com/devnoname120/vitacompanion/issues/20
>
> The current solution is to build 7a9a1a44c648bf995bfbd11c00fd3616dcc6bd7c yourself.

### Cat-A-Log

[Cat-A-Log](https://github.com/isage/catlog) is used to read logs live from the PS Vita in your development machine's
terminal.

To install Cat-A-Log on the PS Vita:

1. Download **catlog.suprx** and **catlog.skprx** from: https://github.com/isage/catlog/releases/latest
2. Upload both files to the PS Vita into the directory: **ur0:tai/**
3. Add this to **ur0:tai/config.txt**:
    ```text
    *KERNEL
    ur0:tai/catlog.skprx
    *NPXS10015
    ur0:tai/catlog.suprx
    ```
4. Reboot the PS Vita
5. Get your computer's IP address, then input it in: Settings > Network > Cat Log > Log host
    1. Set **Log port** to: 10224
    2. Then return to main Settings menu
6. In your local terminal run `make recv-logs`, you should instantly see a lot of logs appear

> [!TIP]
> If you don't see any logs, try rebooting the PS Vita.
> If you still don't see any logs, make sure you've set the right IP address and that you can ping the PS Vita from your
> computer.

### Deploy

After you've setup **vitacompanion** and **Cat-A-Log** try deploying this project to the PS Vita.

1. Add this to **ur0:tai/config.txt**:
    ```
    *KERNEL
    ur0:tai/vitaQmBluetooth.skprx
    *main
    ur0:tai/QuickMenuReborn.suprx
    ```
2. Run this command:
    ```bash
    make PSVITA_IP=192.168.0.100 deploy-init deploy reboot recv-logs
    ```

## Releases

These are the steps a maintainer will take to make a new release.

1. Create a new pull request with the following changes:
    1. Finalize the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file and resetting the **Unreleased** section to "N/A".
    2. Set the new version in the top [`CMakeLists.txt`](CMakeLists.txt) file.
2. TODO
